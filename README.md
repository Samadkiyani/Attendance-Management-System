# Attendance-Management-System
I developed an attendance management system with a Python front end and an SQL back end for efficient tracking and management of employee attendance. The system offers an intuitive interface for logging attendance and generating reports. SQL ensures robust data handling and secure storage, while Python provides a user-friendly experience.
